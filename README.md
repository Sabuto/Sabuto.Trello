# Sabuto.Trello

### This is a client that helps you interact with the trello api, the reason i am writing this is because all of the current projects are either too old or are not being maintained.

You can find api documentation [here](https://sabuto.github.io/Sabuto.Trello/) I will update the articles to give clearer instructions on how to use it. You can also look at the example app.

## Not all of the endpoints are implemented yet.
